# ThemeKit Helper
Command Line Helper Tool for ThemeKit

## Capabilities:

- Generate Info.plist for Themes
- Create Valid Theme Bundles with an Info.plist

## Installation:

#### Requirements:

- Python 3

Run:

```bash
pip3 install themekit-cli
```

After letting it install you can now run:

## Usage:

Your theme should be in a `.bundle` folder with each image representing an Icon for it's application with the same bundleID as the name of the image. Example: Safari = `com.apple.safari`

To see more Bundle IDs visit the [ThemeKit Wiki Here](https://github.com/ThemeKitApp/ThemeKit/wiki)

The entire program is basically a Wizard so you should be able to walk through it fairly easily. If you have issues contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxbridgland)
